## temperature_etoh_ij_ambient.py
Creates plots for the ethanol impinging jet ambient temperature spray. Tested locations include: 

`y = [0.1, 1, 2, 2.5, 4, 15, 25]`

## temperature_etoh_tablescan_ij.py
Creates plots for the ethanol impinging jet table scan (425). 

## temperature_fitting_h2o_ij.py
Creates plots for the water mixing impinging jet scans. Tested locations include:

`y = [0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0]`

## temperature_processing_2017-2.py
Creates the calibration data sets for the APS 2017-2 jets: dodecane, water, and ethanol. Calibration sets are used in the fitting of the impinging jet spray used in the other python scripts.
